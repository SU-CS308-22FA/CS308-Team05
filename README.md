RATE12, in association with the Turkish Football Federation, is a web application designed to give users, football clubs and TFF affiliates a common platform from which they can reach to:individual match datas,league standings,comment sections,question/answer forms etc. 

The application has customizable user informations where the users can change their creditentials (email,password,username,etc..). It also has an FAQ page where users can view the most asked questions and their respective answers given by the administrators. This allows the users to be quickly informed without any other extra activity, easing the time of receiving information.

  If the user could not find an answer that satisfied them in the FAQ page, they can always send their question to our admins: Just enter the user name, the admin name     and your question and our admins will quickly return to you!
  
It also has a comment section, where many users can share their thoughts and ideas on any topic (i.e the latest matches, how the application is, team discussions, fruitful football debates, etc.). We believe this allows for the strengthening of bonds between the football community which ultimately is hoped to improve the current football culture in Turkey since RATE12 is a common medium for not only the fans, but also football clubs and TFF affiliates. However, users have to be careful, polite and not insulting in the comment section as they can be banned or restricted from our applicartion. Any account that violates such protocols will be under review and left to the decision of the administrator.

RATE12 also provides an -although rather small- news page, where the users can view the last 3 tweets from the official Twitter account of the Turkish Football Federation. This way, users can be up-to-date with the latest news in the world of football.

With RATE12, we aimed to give our users an easy and efficient platform where they can receive crucial data on spesific matches like the player names, formations, goals scored, goals conceded points won/lost,etc.; the league standings, news about TFF and many more. We believe RATE12's most important aspect and selling point though, is the coherent existence of various account types like clubs and affiliates along with the general user. This allows the general user to be more in touch with what is going on in the league as they can contact these accounts. Our application plays the role of a medium, in which users can debate, express their opinions and consult to others for corrections or just to gather information in general. The football culture in Turkey has been seeing corruption and decrease in quality over the years. RATE12 aims to play a role in improving the culture and bring back football to where it was in the past: The top of the sports ladder in our country!
